A Simple CSV editor for OS X.

## Instructions

### Open Files

Open files by just dragging a .csv file (e.g. from Finder) on the xCSV icon in the Dock. 
Or use the common way: File > Open.

xCSV detects the format of the chosen file automatically. Sometimes, there might be a problem with the detection, so you can set the format of the document manually at the bottom of the main window.

Once a file format is saved or the file is edited the format must not be changed again.
If you want the file in a different format, you can convert the document of course. Converting is explained below.

### Edit Files

**Cells:** Edit the contents of a cell by selecting the row. Then click again in the specified cell.

**Add/Remove/Duplicate:** Select row(s) > right mouse click / ctrl click > Add Above/Add Below/…
Hint: Rows can also be removed using the 'Delete-Key' on your keyboard.

**Dragging:** Rows and columns can also be reordered by simple dragging a either the selected rows or a column header to the specified position. Holding the option (alt) key while dragging rows copies the dragged rows to the desired location.
It is also possible to drag rows to a different file if the count of the columns of both files fit.

**Headers:** If your document uses the first row as a header and you want to change the header of a column you only have to deselect the header button in the format view on the bottom of the window, change the cell and finally selecte the header button again.

### Convert Files

File > Convert…
Then set the desired format and choose a location on your mac where you want the file to be saved.

### Searching

Open the search field by cmd + F or Edit > Find > Find…
Enter some text and the app searches in the document for it.
The search results is highlighted.
If there is more than one search result, hit enter to iterate over all results.
The number of results is displayed after the search field.
